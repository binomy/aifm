# Topics of the week

## Day one

### Review
- central tendencies - mean, median, mode, std, variance,
  IQR

- probability
  - Bayes theorem
  - Probability Distribution
    - Binomial
    - Gaussian
    - z = x - u / std
    - z scores values are generally between -3 to 3
    - If we know the z value we can find the probability using norm.cdf(z), this will tell us the probability of something happening or less

### Central limit theorem
- find probablity of population using a sample
- *CLT allows us to quantify how good an approximation of a sample mean to the population mean*
- stdErr describes how precies the mean of the sample is versus the true mean of the population

### labs will cover different sources of pricing data
