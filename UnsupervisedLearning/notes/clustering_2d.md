# Clustering 2D points

From the scatter plot of the previous exercise, you saw that the points seem to separate into 3 clusters. You'll now create a KMeans model to find 3 clusters, and fit it to the data points from the previous exercise. After the model has been fit, you'll obtain the cluster labels for some new points using the .predict() method.

You are given the array points from the previous exercise, and also an array new_points.

```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

# Create a KMeans instance with 3 clusters: model
model = KMeans(n_clusters=3)

# Fit model to points
model.fit(points)

# Determine the cluster labels of new_points: labels
labels = model.predict(new_points)

# Print cluster labels of new_points
print(labels)
```

## Inspect your clustering

Let's now inspect the clustering you performed in the previous exercise!

A solution to the previous exercise has already run, so new_points is an array of points and labels is the array of their cluster labels.

```python
# Import pyplot
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assign the columns of new_points: xs and ys
xs = new_points[:,0]
ys = new_points[:,1]

# Make a scatter plot of xs and ys, using labels to define the colors
plt.scatter(xs, ys, c=labels, alpha=0.5)

# Assign the cluster centers: centroids
centroids = model.cluster_centers_

# Assign the columns of centroids: centroids_x, centroids_y
centroids_x = centroids[:,0]
centroids_y = centroids[:,1]

# Make a scatter plot of centroids_x and centroids_y
plt.scatter(centroids_x, centroids_y, marker='D', s=50)
plt.show()
```

## Evaluating the clustering using crosstab

```python
# Create a KMeans model with 3 clusters: model
model = KMeans(n_clusters=3)

# Use fit_predict to fit model and obtain cluster labels: labels
labels = model.fit_predict(samples)

# Create a DataFrame with labels and varieties as columns: df
df = pd.DataFrame({'labels': labels, 'varieties': varieties})

# Create crosstab: ct
ct = pd.crosstab(df['labels'], df['varieties'])

# Display ct
print(ct)
```
