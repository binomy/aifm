# Comparing Returns

- Annual return - Total return earned over a period of one calender year
- Annualized return - Yearly **rate of return** inferred from any time period
- Average Return - Total return realized over a longer period, spread out evenly over the (shorter) periods.
- Cumulative (compounding) return - A return that includes the compounded results of re-investing interest, dividends, and capital gains.

## Calculating annualized returns

- **N in years**: $rate = (1 + Return)^{1/N} - 1$
- **N in months**: $rate = (1 + Return)^{12/N} - 1$
